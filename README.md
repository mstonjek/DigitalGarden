Welcome to the **Digital Garden** project! This is a virtual garden where anyone can plant a flower. All you need is a GitHub account and a bit of imagination. But there's a catchâ€”each user can plant only one flower! 

This project has the potential to grow into a vast herbal collection ðŸŒ», but it needs some dedicated gardeners to make that happen. If you're reading this, why not plant a flower? If you want to, of course.

**Please note**: This is a very early demo, so the entire site isn't fully designed yet. You might encounter some bugs, and there's a slight chance I could accidentally delete the databaseâ€”hopefully not, but accidents happen!
